Stop My Procrastination

!! WIP !!

This small homemade extension helps people that can't help procrastinating, because some websites have become far too addictive - and so is procrastination.

Once the user has spent 10 minutes on a procrastinating website, a popup will be displayed to remind them that there are more useful things to do!

The time can be set between 5 and 50 minutes.
The websites can be given.

Default values are:
 - time = 10 minutes
 - websites = [
   9gag,
   facebook,
   twitter,
   reddit,
   whatsapp,
   instagram,
   youtube,
   linkedin
 ]

N.B.: LinkedIn has been added as well since it has become a social media more than a professional network.
